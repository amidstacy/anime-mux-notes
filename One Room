notes: 
renamed naming for media center support
incase u are wondering, i did not fix any TS problems (don't worry they wont ruin your 'experience' and as far as i remember there was just 1)
I released this because i really liked the ED music/and was really bored at that time, so the main reason why i did this was because i wanted the CDs but decided to do the anime anyway.
