first time using github so dont question me why i did this 

overall changes:
SNSbu as base for subs. restyled dialogue, restyled ed fonts, used Beatrice-raws for Season 1, VCB-Studio for Season 2, and BDMV for Season 3. (thanks v01 for the bdmv!)


Season 1 Changes
Replaced some dialogues on episode 9 and 12 to ed styling because she singing ayyoooo
Replaced the famous line on episode 6 'Would you like dinner, a bath, or... me?' to > Would you like dinner? A bath? Or perhaps... ...me? 


Season 2 Changes
not much changes; restyled dialogue, ed font, vcb video.


Season 3 Changes
Added Romaji for ED. Thanks to Setsugen_no_ao for the Romaji and English translations! Expect ED consistency across all seasons.
Added Italics where needed. (flashbacks only) 
Tweaked Typesetting















notes: 
incase u are wondering, i did not fix any TS problems (don't worry they wont ruin your 'experience' and as far as i remember there was just 1)
I released this because i really liked the ED music/and was really bored at that time, so the main reason why i did this was because i wanted the CDs but decided to do the anime anyway.
No I am not doing the NCs please no oh god why. Recommend to just get them from SNSbu. Don't care about season 3.
