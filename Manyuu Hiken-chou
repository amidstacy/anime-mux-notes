Resampled subtitles. Restyled Dialogue. Removed unnecessary lines. (lines that aren't shown up on the screen) Removed Kanji for OP/ED. I will provide a second subtitle track 
where the kanji on the karaoke is kept. :) UPDATE: Too lazy, so no kanji for ya. :kekw: Redid some TS. If there are any issues, please report



Special mention: tsuki for the memes and how i initally got to start muxing this show
