encoded PCM > FLAC 16bit using eac3t0,Resampled subtitles. Restyled Dialogue. Removed unnecessary lines. (lines that aren't shown up on the screen) Removed Kanji for OP/ED. I will provide a second subtitle track 
where the kanji on the karaoke is kept. :) UPDATE: Too lazy, so no kanji for ya. :kekw: Redid/tweaked most of the  TS as there's scenebleeds everywhere. 
If there are any issues, please report


Notes: Episode 7, 6:38. I pretty much fucked the upper sign and dont have the energy for it to fix so i left it. (Still readable, just it looks a bit too fucked)
Special mention: tsuki for the memes and how i initally got to start doing the show
